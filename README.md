## Technologies Used

  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework for styling
  - [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - For handling navigation between different sections.
  - [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - For schema validation.
  - [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/): For toast notifications.
  - [html-to-image](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/): For generating images of the ticket

- **Image Hosting:**

  - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - Cloud-based image management (optional, but recommended for handling avatar uploads).

- **Local Storage:**
  - Used for persisting data.

## How to Build This üöÄ

This UI can be implemented using:

- **Frontend (React):**

  - **Pages Breakdown:**

    - `SelectTicket.tsx`: Allows users to select the ticket type and number of tickets.
    - `AttendeeDetails.tsx`: Captures user details (Name, Email, Profile Picture, Special Request).
    - `TicketReady.tsx`: Shows the final ticket preview with a download option.

  - **State Management:** This project uses simple `useState` for demonstration.
  - **File Handling:** This project uses Cloudinary for image handling.

## Installation

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

## How It Works üßë‚Äçüíª

5. Users can:
   - Download the ticket as an image
   - Delete individual tickets
   - Delete all tickets

## Areas for Extension

This project provides a solid foundation, but there's plenty of room for improvement and expansion:

- **Payment Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) to handle paid tickets.
- **User Authentication:** Add user registration and login functionality.
- **Backend Integration:** Connect the frontend to a backend database to store ticket information and user data.
- **QR Code Generation:** Implement QR code generation for tickets and a system for scanning and validating tickets at the event.
- **Email Confirmation:** Send automated email confirmations to users after successful ticket booking.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Thoroughly test and improve the accessibility of the form and ticket components.
- **More Robust State Management:** Implement Redux, Recoil, or Zustand for state management.
- **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests.
